There are only 5 yeasts here because I've excluded the yeast that didn't grow 

### Three excel files -

`egglay..` - all the behavior data for all fly lines and all yeast. Trials are organized by different yeast (one yeast per sheet)

`gcms_vals_norepeats` - the first column here is the peak_position and we can use as a "name" for each peak. these are true values for reach averaged yeast

`gcms_vals_normalized_norepeats` - this is the data normalized (across rows). B Basically the same as what I gave you before `alli_example_data.xlsx` without the mean/variance columns and only the peak_position column
